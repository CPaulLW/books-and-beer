    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Clay, and I am– among a few other things– a lifelong lover of fiction and a craft beer enthusiast. After travelling to enough new places, it became clear to me that there are a few staples that I always seek out when visiting a city for the first time. Good bookstores can be hard to come by in 2025; therefore, I want to share them whenever I find them! Quality pubs are, of course, easier to find– but when I visit an outstanding spot, or try a delicious local beer, then I like to shine a spotlight on it. So browse my site, choose a city you’re interested in and find out what can’t be missed as far as books and brew go. You can also check out my list of literary recommendations and favorite beers of all time. Thanks for visiting!</p>
