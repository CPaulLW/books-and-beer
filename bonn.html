    <h2>Best Bookstore</h2>
    <p>Thalia has one of the best English-language selections in the area. Located directly in the heart of the city, the bookstore is a former theatre and boasts the corresponding architecture. With several rows of the former seats preserved, this makes for a lovely place to spend your afternoon with a book.</p>

    <h2>Best Pub</h2>
    <p>The James Joyce is a traditional Irish pub with good beer and a great atmosphere. The pub snacks are also worth trying!</p>

    <h2>Local Beer</h2>
    <p>Kölsch is the region’s signature beer style—light, crisp, and slightly fruity. Kölsch is from the city Köln, or Cologne in English. It is served in extra small glasses to preserve the freshness.</p>
